    "Futures have additionally characteristics that make them distinct from map:\n",
    "* They are **Asynchronous**, they start *in the background* according to the scheduler\n",
    "* Futures can depend on other futures, without requiring the results to be ready\n",
    "* Future results are not automatically transferred to the client, one must call **result**\n",
